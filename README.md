## Live demo here: https://lucasms115.github.io/best-sliding-puzzle/

Sliding puzzle created with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS inspired by one of the greatest movie scenes of all time.

I'm currently working on a solving algorithm inspired by the Manhattan Distance Heuristic to solve it.
Also needs to do a good animation or something when the puzzle is completed :)
