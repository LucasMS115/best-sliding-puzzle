Sliding puzzle created with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS inspired by one of the greatest movie scenes of all time.

I made an algorithm inspired by the Manhattan Distance Heuristic to solve it. There's a button at the bottom right to start it.
Also, there is a very good animation for you when the puzzle is completed! Just be careful with the volume of your fones.
